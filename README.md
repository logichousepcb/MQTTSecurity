This PCB and software replaces your alarm panel with MQTT publish events

I would publish the steps I took as a how to guide for those wishing to replace their alarm panel with a simple device that publishes MQTT messages based on activity of the system.

I have designed a circuit board,will be soldering, modifying software to run it on a Arduino and ESP8266, and finally integrating it into my home automation system.  I am using Home Assistant.
